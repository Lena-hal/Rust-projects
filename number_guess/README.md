# Random Number Guessing Game

This is a simple project I created while learning Rust. It is a console-based game where the player tries to guess a random number generated by the computer.
## Getting Started

To run the game, you will need to have Rust installed on your system. You can download and install Rust from the official website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Once Rust is installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Then run the following command to start the game:

`cargo run`

## How to Play

- The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
- You will be prompted to enter your guess.
- If your guess is too low, the game will tell you to guess higher.
- If your guess is too high, the game will tell you to guess lower.
- Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.

## Acknowledgements

This project was created using the Rust programming language and the rand crate for generating random numbers.
